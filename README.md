## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.


2. Change into the project directory.


3. Install dependencies.



The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Overview

In this example, we have a simple form with three inputs (username, email, and password). The form uses controlled inputs, which means their values are managed by React state.

### Input Validation

- Username: Required; cannot be empty.(StephanMaina)
- Email: Must be a valid email address.(Popsmokedriller092@gmail.com)
- Password: Must be at least 6 characters long.(**************)

The form will display error messages if any of the input values fail validation.

### Form Submission

1. User fills in the form.
2. As the user types, the input values are updated in the React state.
3. When the user submits the form, the form's `onSubmit` event is triggered.
4. The `handleSubmit` function is called, which performs final validation and checks if the form data is valid.
5. If the form data is valid, it will be logged to the console as a successful submission.
6. If the form data is invalid, an error message will be logged to the console, and the form will not be submitted.
